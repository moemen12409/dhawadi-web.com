    <ol>
            <li> Use goal projects as your guide</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    “The most important thing a programmer can do to improve is to figure out their learning style,
                    ”<br> says Thomas Jimenez, a developer advocate at Wix.
                     <br>“Some folks learn better from direct experience,
                      so they prefer to follow along with tutorials,<br>
                       whereas others are more comfortable dissecting documentation.”</li>
            </ul>
                <li>Embrace failure</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>“A lot of today’s leadership expect you to know everything right off the bat,
                         <br>which is obviously impossible,” says Cao.
                         <br> She adds that one of the most important things a programmer can do is work where there’s psychological safety. 
                         <br>Making mistakes (and fixing them) is an inherent part of being a programmer, <br>
                         so it’s critical to find projects, teams and organizations that reward trying new things as opposed to reprimanding failed attempts.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Join the club</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>“Joining communities should be an imperative for every programmer. Whether it’s going to college or joining a bootcamp or forum, learning is multiplied in social settings and struggling is multiplied when you go at it alone” says Jimenez.


                        Being part of a community can offer a behind-the-scenes look at how products are made and introduce you to unknowns you otherwise wouldn’t have been aware of. Most of all, though, communities provide feedback loops, which help you pick up new programming skills.
                        
                        
                        Some solid places to start:
                        
                        The Wix Studio Community
                        
                        The Devs on Wix Discord
                        
                        Code with Ania Kubow
                        
                        
                      </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Take on pair programming</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A quick refresher: Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at a single workstation. One programmer is the driver, meaning they’re the one that writes the code, and the other programmer is the navigator, who reviews the code and offers feedback as it's being written. The two often swap places to give each developer a chance to code and reflect.


                        AI can also step in here. “I use Chat GPT all the time when I’m unsure if the code I’ve written is the best way to structure what I’m trying to do,” says Jimenez.
                        
                        
                        “Pair programming is scary for people at first because there's literally someone watching what you're doing,” says Cao. “Getting over that fear of messing up and looking dumb is its own challenge, but it’s the closest you can get to stepping into someone's head.”</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Tap a robot</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Speaking of artificial intelligence, Wix Studio features an AI assistant that helps devs ship code faster and learn in the process. You can get custom tailored scripts and troubleshoot at lightning speeds to make sure your code works the way it was intended. And for those especially eager to learn how to be a better programmer, Wix Studio’s AI explains its code suggestions so you can put it to use in the future.


                        On that note, Kubow says AI is best used as a tool, not a crutch. “Don’t rely on it too heavily because half the battle is solving it yourself,” she says.

                        </li>
                </ul>
            <li> Try new frameworks</li>
            <ul>
                <li>“Since there isn’t any one-size-fits-all technology out there, the framework wars have become quite contentious,” says Jimenez. “Every use case has a lot of different platforms, so don’t be afraid to try new tools and frameworks when the recipe calls for it.”


                    At the end of the day, the best framework to use comes down to the problem that you're trying to solve, and the best tool for you to do it. “We've been seeing a lot of framework-driven development where people build very specifically towards React, Next.js, Laravel or Vue, and they get so comfortable in one framework that they forget the fundamentals and start living in a bubble,” says Williams. 
                    
                    
                    She adds that you want to be able to build things without relying on a singular framework so that if, for whatever reason, your preferred framework falls by the wayside, you’re still employable. Before your next project, take a step back and ask yourself—and your team or community—to consider the best framework for the job. It might help you avoid racking up technical debt in the process.</li>
